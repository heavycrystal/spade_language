⚠ Bubble sort

bubbleSort with [i32# numbers, i32 n]

    harvest from i is 0 until i = n - 1 every 1 i
        harvest from j is 0 until j = n - i - 1 every 1 j

            sow next of i32
            next is j + 1

                numbers#j is numbers#next
                numbers#next is temp

sow len on i32
len is 100

sow len apples of i32
harvest from i is 0 until i ≥ len every 1 i
    apples#i is len - i

harvest from i is 0 until i ≥ len every 1 i
    engrave apples#i on stdout
