sow n of i32
n is 100000

here lies Tree
__________
|
|   sow val of i32
|   sow left of Tree
|   sow right of Tree
|__________

solve with [root]
    sow n parents of Tree
    sow plen of i32
    parents#0 is root
    plen is 1

    sow n children of Tree
    sow c of i32
    c is 0

    sow n solution of Tree
    solution#0 is root->val
    sow s of i32
    s is 1

    sow is_right of b1
    is_right is ❌

    harvest eternally
        harvest from p = 0 until p >= plen every 1 p
            parents#p->left fresh?
                children#c is parents#p->left

                children#c is parents#p->right
                c is c + 1

        c == 0 fresh?
            kill

        is_right fresh?
            harvest from i = 0 until i >= c every 1 i
                solution#s is children#c->val
